## Goals
We created this repository with the primary goal of showing relatively new coders (althought not necessarily!) ways to access data via code that they might usually get via point and click on websites or require someone else to pull. 

## What this is not
This is not the *only* or necessarily even the optimal way to get this data. We don't cover the full spectrum of every API or package we use - just a quick sample to get people pointed in the right direction. 

## Collaboration encouraged!
Want to contribute to the repository? Make a PR with a ideally shortish R or Python script/notebook/markdown that does something we don't have, or does what we have better. If you're PR includes a new data source, please create Your_New_Data_Source/ inside the main folder and place your code in there. Want to add more functionality to what we already have - then just add into the existing data folder.
